# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python

Name your project rps.py

Use Python 3.x

Implement a rock-paper-scissors game.

    The player enters 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors.
    The computer randomly selects one of the three itself.
    The program displays computer and player choices and who won (or if it is a tie).
    Ask the player if they would like to play again.

Implement the following features in addition to the game play:

    Keep a count of the number of times the player won, lost, and tied. Display these counts when the player ends the game.
    Keep a count of the number of times the player selects rock, selects scissors, and selects paper. When the player stops playing display these counts.
    After the game ends, display who won the most rounds and the object the winner won the most rounds with.
    After the game ends, tell the player which single object would have had the maximum number of wins against the computer.
    Use python's random.randint() function to generate the computer's choice.
